- The idea and use of ORM models
- Implementing custom authentication flow

### Problems and overall idea changes

- Chose not to use passport js for now due to difficulty  in implementation
- Using sequelize ORM which helps me build different models, to make it easier to implement in database
- Using bcrypt to manually encrypt passwords 
- Learning about good methods of implementing databases and how to work around auth
- Authentication has been very difficult in terms of understanding and implementation 
- Understanding express-sessions better and how to use them

### Current Problems
- Remembering logged in user for an extended period of time
- Removing favourites correctly in the market view section


### What I Learned
- **Tailwind CSS**: Explored and implemented Tailwind CSS for styling, achieving a streamlined and responsive design.
- **ORM Models**: Utilized Sequelize ORM for defining and managing database models, facilitating easier data manipulation.
- **Custom Authentication Flow**: Implemented a custom authentication system, learning essential techniques for user login and session management.
- **Database Implementation**: Gained insights into effective database strategies and authentication methods.

### Problems Encountered and Changes Made
Passport.js Decision: Opted against using Passport.js initially due to complexity in integration.

## Installation
If you would like a local installation of the project follow these steps:

- Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/sush-il/Penny-Track.git
- Navigate to the project directory and run `npm install` on the terminal to install all dependencies
- Set up your TrueLayer API account and obtain client id and client secret. (Ensure this is for Live Environment as the sandbox environment requires different settings)
- Create a .env file in the project's server directory and add the following information:
    - `LIVE_CLIENT_ID = ...`
    - `LIVE_CLIENT_SECRET = ...`
    - `REDIRECT_URI = ...` (must be same as the one in TrueLayers API account)
    - `SECRET_KEY = ...` (this is for express-sessions; but the feature isn't completed atm)

- Run the client and server
    - `npm run dev`
